# Known Issues

Findings from the legacy-to-clean-repo migration that affect interpretation
of existing results or explain deviations from a literal AnalysisNote copy.
Nothing here should reference a private site path or a tracking-issue
identifier; see the migration plan documents for those.

## 1. Rapidity / pseudorapidity branch swap (spec D18)

The AnalysisNote `flatTreePrep.C` defined `*_rapidity` as
`atanh(p4.Pz()/p4.P())` (that is pseudorapidity) and `*_prapidity` as
`TLorentzVector::Rapidity()` (true rapidity) — the names were swapped for
`kphigh`, `kplow`, and `ystar`. `analyses/kpkpxim/selection/flatTreePrep.C`
now defines these branches with the gx1 `PrepFlatTrees.C` naming instead:
`*_rapidity` is `TLorentzVector::Rapidity()` and `*_prapidity` is
`atanh(pz/p)`.

The nominal K⁺(high) rapidity cut and the Barlow `kphigh_prap` systematic
variations call `TLorentzVector::Rapidity()` directly on the four-vector
(never through the swapped branch names), so those selections are
unaffected by either the bug or the fix.

Figures and tables that read the swapped branch names directly are affected
and must be regenerated:
- The rapidity cut-study plots, `selection/cut_studies/rapidity_cuts/get_data_hists.C`.
- The kinematics comparisons, `selection/GetKinematicsDataMC_RF.C`.

Legacy binned trees produced before this fix carry `kphigh_prapidity`
(and the `kplow_`/`ystar_` equivalents) holding true rapidity; after this
fix, the same branch name holds pseudorapidity. Any script consuming a
pre-fix binned tree must account for this when comparing to trees produced
by the migrated `flatTreePrep.C`.

`flatTreePrepQVal.C` does not define any `*_rapidity`/`*_prapidity`
branches, so it is unaffected by the swap and was not changed.

## 2. Documented, not fixed

The following legacy behaviors are preserved as faithful copies and are
not in scope for this migration:
- DSelector `cout` spam during processing.
- Commented-out PID ΔT and Ξ⁻ mass-window cuts.
- `Xim1320Properties.h` and `Xim1320Properties.cpp` disagreed; fixed on
  migration (b6e3cef aligned the header to the .cpp).
- `PlotComponents.C` name clash; fixed on migration (f58181b renamed the
  function).
- `GetBarlowResults.C` reads from `xsection/data_files`.
- `MakeHistoQVal.C` defines `MakeHistos()`, not `MakeHistoQVal()`; archived rather than fixed.

## 3. Legacy drivers that never ran as checked in

`RunAnalysis.sh` and `RunXSec.py` are archived rather than migrated as
working drivers: neither reflects the order analysis stages were actually
run in. `analyses/kpkpxim/README.md` documents the real stage order.

## 4. Fixed in their own migration plans

- QFactors `qvalueSum` and the VLA branch handling: a later migration plan.
- The MCwrapper `>>!` (ROOT's "always overwrite" Snapshot option) handling: a later migration plan.
